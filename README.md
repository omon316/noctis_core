Noctis Core

Noctis Core is a unified, modular signal-intelligence orchestration framework.
It coordinates multiple RF and sensor tools (e.g. KrakenSDR, ADS-B decoders, rtl_433, Kismet, GR-GSM), ingests their outputs into a common schema, stores them across time-series and spatial databases, and presents them through a web dashboard with maps, charts, search, and export capabilities.

üèó Architecture & Components

Noctis Core connects to external tools like KrakenSDR, tar1090, Kismet, rtl_433 and GR-GSM.
These tools feed data via HTTP, MQTT, CLI or REST into the Noctis Core backend.
The backend normalizes and stores data in InfluxDB, PostgreSQL/PostGIS and NDJSON/Parquet archives.
The frontend visualizes this information via a unified web dashboard.

Key modules include:

Collector adapters for ADS-B, rtl_433, Kismet, GSM, Kraken

Normalizer to transform raw responses into a unified Observation schema

Storage layers:

Time-series (InfluxDB or Timescale)

Spatial (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)

Archive (NDJSON + Parquet)

REST / WebSocket API for summary, events, search, health, scan control

Frontend dashboard with tiles, map, charts, search and service links

Export pipeline for live (WebSocket/MQTT/optional CoT) and post-scan data (CoT, GeoJSON, CSV, Parquet, SensorThings)

üì¶ Quick Start

Clone the repository

Create and activate a Python virtual environment

Install backend dependencies using
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the backend server:
uvicorn noctis_core.backend.app.main:app --reload

Serve the frontend/ directory as static files (via backend or simple HTTP server)

Open the dashboard in a browser and configure collector endpoints / external tool URLs

üß† Data Model (Observation & Session)

Each collected event is normalized into a JSON observation:

ts ‚Äì ISO timestamp
session_id ‚Äì e.g. S2025-10-13-001
source ‚Äì adsb, gsm, ism, bt, kismet, kraken
device_id ‚Äì identifier (e.g. ICAO, cell ID, MAC)
event ‚Äì contact, bcch_update, door_open, present, bearing, health
value ‚Äì numeric or string data
loc ‚Äì object with lat/lon/alt
meta ‚Äì additional metadata like frequency, RSSI, band, raw payload

A ScanSession stores metadata about each scan (start/end time, receivers, flags, export options, etc.).

üîç Search & Query Capabilities

Quicksearch / full-text over device IDs and metadata

Faceted filters (source, event, session, frequency band)

Time range filtering

Geo search using polygons or radius

Saved query templates (e.g. ‚ÄúADS-B flights over my location in last 24 h‚Äù)

üóÇ Storage & Export Formats

Time-series: InfluxDB or TimescaleDB

Spatial: PostgreSQL + PostGIS

Archive: NDJSON & Parquet per session/day

Exports: CoT ZIP, GeoJSON FeatureCollections, CSV/NDJSON, Parquet, SensorThings bundles

üöÄ Next Milestones

Implement and integrate collector adapters

Connect them to storage pipelines

Complete API logic for each endpoint

Improve frontend: map, charts, search UI

Build export engine

Add health monitoring, logging, error handling, and security

üìö Standards & References

OGC SensorThings API ‚Äì open spatial standard for observations

MQTT extension for SensorThings ‚Äì publish/subscribe for observations

Sensor Observation Service (SOS) ‚Äì earlier OGC standard in the same domain

üõ° Security & Network Model

All backend and collector services bind only to the ZeroTier interface

Authentication and authorization for API and UI

Health checks, logging, fallback handling, provenance metadata
